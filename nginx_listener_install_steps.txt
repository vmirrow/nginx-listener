# Modify the ActiveMQ credentials and host in the nginx routing listener. The
# intent here is to run this routing listener on each nginx proxy. Also modify
# the nginx reload command to be `service nginx16-nginx reload`. Also modify
# the domain name for applications to reflect the actual domain for apps, as
# an example: (server_name ha-#{scope}.us.platform.dell.com;). This file is
# located under /usr/sbin/oo-nginx-routing.rb.

# Start the oo-nginx-routing service
service oo-nginx-routing start

# Set service to start on reboot
chkconfig --add oo-nginx-routing
ckconfig oo-nginx-routing on
